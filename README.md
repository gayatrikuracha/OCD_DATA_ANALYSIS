# OCD_DATA_ANALYSIS
# Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing data related to patients diagnosed with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). The analysis includes examining various factors such as gender distribution, ethnicity, trends over time, common compulsions, and their correlation with obsession scores. The goal is to gain insights into the characteristics and trends of OCD patients, which can inform clinical practices and interventions.

# Data Sources
The data used in this analysis originates from an OCD patient dataset. The dataset contains information on patient demographics, diagnosis dates, obsession and compulsion types, and corresponding scores.

# Tools
- SQL for data querying and analysis
- Power BI for data visualization and dashboard creation
- Excel for additional data visualization and analysis

# Data Cleaning
The dataset was prepared through preprocessing to ensure data consistency and accuracy for the analysis. This involved addressing missing or erroneous data, standardizing date formats, and ensuring uniformity in data representation. Additionally, adjustments were made to data types and formats as needed for analysis purposes, which included converting dates to a standardized format.

# Exploratory Data Analysis
Several SQL queries were executed to explore various aspects of the OCD patient dataset, including:
1. Gender distribution and average obsession score
2. Ethnicity distribution and average obsession score
3. Monthly diagnosis trends
4. Most common obsession and compulsion types with their respective counts and average scores

# Findings
1. Gender Distribution: There is an almost equal split between male and female OCD patients, with a slight majority of females. The average obsession score does not significantly differ between genders.
2. Ethnicity Distribution: The dataset shows a diverse representation of ethnicities, with Caucasian being the largest group. Ethnicity does not appear to have a significant impact on average obsession scores.
3. Monthly Diagnosis Trends: There is a potential increase in OCD diagnoses over the years 2014 to 2022.
4. Common Obsession and Compulsion Types: Washing compulsions are the most frequent, followed by checking compulsions. There seems to be a correlation between the number of obsessions and the average obsession score.

# Recommendations
Based on the findings, it is recommended to:
- Further investigate the factors contributing to the observed increase in OCD diagnoses over time.
- Explore potential interventions or support strategies tailored to common obsession and compulsion types.

# Limitations
1. The analysis is based on a specific dataset and may not be generalizable to all OCD patients.
2. The dataset may contain inherent biases or limitations, such as underrepresentation of certain demographics or reliance on self-reported data.
